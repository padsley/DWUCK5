# DWUCK5

Be very, very careful - some of the test cases don't seem to work properly on my laptop - it's possible that DWUCK5 isn't working properly.

You need to check the results extremely carefully for sanity before trying using them.

I've had to comment out a lot of lines which try to call 'ksecond' to work out the time for the running of DWUCK5. It's not really important for modern computers and it means that the thing won't compile if you still have it in.
